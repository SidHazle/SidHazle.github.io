	<h1>4D Drawings</h1>
    <p>Drawing 4D objects is <strong>extremely</strong> difficult. It's about as easy as telling a 2D book page to see 3D objects, except with an extra dimension. To me, the simplest 4D object is the tesseract, as seen below. Look <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Draw-a-Tesseract">here</a> to see how to draw the tesseract below!</p>
